# Deephaven Benchmark Distribution

The Benchmark distribution is a self-contained mechanism for running existing Deephaven operational benchmarks against Deephaven Community Core (DHC) without the need for checking out the Benchmark project or running from Github workflows.

More information about the Deephaven Community Core Benchmark project, including running this distribution, can be found in the [Benchmark Project](https://github.com/deephaven/benchmark) on Github.
